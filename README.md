# A Resume Built in Latex

I've been writing my resume in LaTeX for a while using a template that I've customized, so I figured I'd put in on GitHub for others to see an example of a LaTeX resume.

Each resume section is in its own input file which are all included via LaTeX commands like `\input{education.tex}`.

The pdf may be out of date with the LaTeX content as I have to build then commit and push every time I update content, but I'll try to keep it updated with what the template looks like in pdf form.
